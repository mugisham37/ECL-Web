  {
    q: "Is the ECL output truly deterministic?",
    a: "Yes. Given identical inputs, the engine will always produce bit-for-bit identical output. Every run is hashed and the hash is stored in the audit trail. Your auditor can verify this at any time.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does ECL Platform use AI or machine learning?",
    a: "No. The engine is a pure implementation of the IFRS 9 standard — no neural networks, no black-box models. Every line of the computation is explainable and auditable. AI-based forward-looking overlays are on the roadmap for a later phase, and will be clearly labelled as such.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can we run the platform on our own servers (on-premise)?",
    a: "On-premise deployments are available on the Enterprise plan. Contact us to discuss your infrastructure requirements and data residency constraints.",
  },
  {
    q: "What file formats do you accept for upload?",
    a: "We accept Excel (.xlsx) and CSV. Downloadable templates are provided for each upload type so your team can map existing data with minimal effort.",
  },
  {
    q: "How is our data isolated from other tenants?",
    a: "Each institution is a separate tenant with its own encrypted workspace. There is no shared database layer between tenants. Analysts can only access the workspaces they have been explicitly invited to.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does a typical ECL run take?",
    a: "For portfolios up to 10,000 loans, expect under 60 seconds end-to-end. Larger portfolios (50,000+) are batched and typically complete within 5 minutes.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you support forward-looking overlay (macro scenarios)?",
    a: "A basic forward-looking overlay is on the product roadmap and is not included in the current release. All IFRS 9 base calculations (PD, LGD, EAD, staging) are fully supported today.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can we share run results with external auditors?",
    a: "Yes. Every completed run has a shareable PDF report and a machine-readable JSON export that includes the full audit trail hash. Auditors can verify the hash independently without accessing the platform.",
  },
